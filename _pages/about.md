I am currently a staff researcher and 2nd year Masters Student (2020-2022) at Carnegie Mellon University with [Professor Artur Dubrawski](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/artur-w-dubrawski/)
under the [Auton Lab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/auton-lab/). My areas of focus include Weak Supervision, Unsupervised Feature Representations, and Machine Learning for Healthcare in general. I am also broadly interested in sequential data and Generative Adversarial Networks.

Previously, I obtained my bachelors in Computer Science / Statistical Mathematics from [Purdue University](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/news/2019/spring2019_graduation.html) (2016-2019)

Please check out my [full CV](../assets/pdf/CV.pdf) for a complete list of my activities! Feel free to reach out via the social links at the bottom of the page for further inquiries.

The following is a list of selected publications, please see [Publications](https://chufangao.github.io/publications/) for a complete list of all of my works.
